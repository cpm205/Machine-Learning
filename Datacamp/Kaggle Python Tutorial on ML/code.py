#Overfitting and how to control it
#In DecisionTreeRegressor, the depth of our model is defined by two parameters: - the max_depth parameter determines when the splitting up of the decision tree stops. - the min_samples_split parameter monitors the amount of observations in a bucket.
#If a certain threshold is not reached (e.g minimum 10 passengers) no further splitting can be done.
#By limiting the complexity of your decision tree you will increase its generality and thus its usefulness for prediction!
